This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

I'm Kabil Rajendhiran, I have 2 years of professional experience and 1 year of freelancer experience. I have created this
static page using Nextjs and Tailwind css. I hope this is enough to showcase my talent. I supports from mobile to 
2k screens perfectly. Above 2k you may need to zoom a little bit.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter font.
